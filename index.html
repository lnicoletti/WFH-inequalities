                The March 11, 2020 official World Health Organization (WHO) announcement declaring the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic fundamentally changed societies everywhere.  With government implemented mask mandates and social distancing practices, we no longer work nor play the same as before.  In order to comply with government regulations and craft a more pleasant “new normal”, many employers have adopted a “Work from Home” (WFH) lifestyle.  While WFH has been touted as the be-all and end-all of office productivity while simultaneously providing employees with more flexible work hours and improved overall wellbeing, not everyone has been able to benefit from the shift in work culture that has been brought upon us by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Who really benefits from this new WFH normal?  In investigating this question, we turned to data provided by Google, the UK Office for National Statistics, and the US Census regarding both mobility patterns and median household income in rural and urban areas for the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) over the course of the pandemic.

                <summary class="mapCredit" style="opacity:0.6">What does this visualization show?</summary>
            
                <p class="FigSubtitle">In visualizing the relationship between mobility patterns and median household income, the UK's 374 local authorities and the US's 3,174 counties were explored on a national (i.e. US vs. UK) basis.  With a cartogram approach, each national spatial unit is represented by a <svg width=20 height=20><circle r=10 fill="lightgrey" style="transform:translate(10px, 10px)"></circle></svg>. The resulting color scheme of such circles is twofold.  Each circles' color tone is dependent on both 1) the median household income of the national spatial unit's residents and 2) the residents' percent change in mobility to workplaces relative to a pre-pandemic 2019 baseline. <br><br>

                As such, national spatial units colored in <span class="richtheNytimes">green</span> represent areas where residents are higher income and benefited from WFH policies (i.e., these residents were able to greatly reduce their mobility to the workplace).  Contrastingly, national spatial units colored in <span class="poortheNytimes">orange</span> represent areas where residents are lower income and did not benefit from WFH policies (i.e. these residents were not able to greatly reduce their mobility to the workplace).  National spatial units colored in <span class="richHightheNytimes">dark-green</span> represent areas where residents are higher income and continued to travel to the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Regardless of the wealthy status of these areas, residents did not benefit from WFH practices.  Finally, national spatial units colored in <span class="poorLowtheNytimes">light-grey</span> represent areas where residents are lower income and benefited from WFH policies.  Regardless of the poorer status of these areas, residents in these national spatial units were still able to benefit from WFH practices.<br><br>

                For both the UK and the US, this data highlights the existence of inequality.  In both national instances, the higher a resident's household income, the more likely that they are to benefit from WFH policies.  Similarly, in both the UK and the US, the lower a resident's household income, the less likely that they are to reduce their travel to the workplace and subsequently work from home.  However, while the WFH inequality seems to primarily be a rich vs. poor issue in the UK, in the US, this inequality is starkly compounded by an urban vs. rural divide.  While many wealthy US residents have been able to reduce their travel to the workplace and benefit from a WFH lifestyle during the pandemic, these individuals overwhelmingly reside in urban areas.  Contrastingly, many poorer US residents, who have been unable to reap the benefits of WFH policies, reside in rural areas.  In the US, the rich vs. poor divide seems to be somewhat one and the same with the urban vs. rural divide.  When and why did the rural US become so disenfranchised?  Have WFH policies forgotten middle-America?  How can rural American residents also experience a more pleasant “new normal” amidst this pandemic era?

                
                <!-- For both the United Kingdom and the United States, these charts highlight the existence of a strong social and spatial segregation with regards to who has worked from home and who has continued to commute to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United Kingdom, close to 50% (~30% in the United States) of administrative units are described by either the low income/high commute profile or the high income/low commute profile. Conversely, only 5% (~10% in the United States) of administrative units are described by either the high income/high commute profile or the low income/low commute profile. This trend is explained by the fact that, in both countries, there is a strong negative linear relationship between household income and the intensity of travel to workplaces - that is - the higher your household income is, the less likely you are to travel to work and the more likely you are to work from home. -->

            <!-- <div class="FigSubtitle">This visualization illustrates the relationship between median household income and the intensity in travel to workplaces over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this map, areas coloured in gold represent areas that are both high income and that experienced lower levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic. Here, residents of these wealthier areas were able to successfully reduce their mobility and adopt a work-from-home lifestyle.  In contrast, areas coloured in purple represent areas that are both low income and that did not experience lower levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic.  Residents of these poorer areas were not able to reduce their mobility as much, and they continued to commute to work. Finally, shades of brown represent (the few) local authorities that are both high income and that experienced higher levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic.  Regardless of the wealthy status of these areas, residents continued to commute to work.

                This visualization was created using aggregated mobility data for the United Kingdom and the United States from <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/?hl=en" target="__blank">Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports</a>, household income data from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/placeofresidencebylocalauthorityashetable8" target="__blank">Office for National Statistics</a> and the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data.html" target="__blank">U.S. Census</a>, and rural population data from the United States's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html" target="__blank">2020 Census Urban and Rural Classification</a> and the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/ruralurbanclassifications/2011ruralurbanclassification" target="__blank">2011 Rural Urban Classification</a>.<br><br>
            
                For each administrative area in both the United Kingdom and the United States, temporal data on mobility to work-places was aggregated spatially by computing the median change in mobility over the course of the pandemic (February 2020-Today) relative to Google's 2019 baseline. By using rural population data, each area with a rural population greater than 50% was classified as "Rural" and each area with a rural population lower than 50% was classified as "Urban".<br><br>

                Raw data was cleaned and processed with Javascript inside an <a href="https://observablehq.com" target="__blank">Observable</a> notebook.
