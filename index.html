                <p class="FigSubtitle">This visualization illustrates the relationship between median household income and the intensity in travel to workplaces over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In these charts, each <svg width=20 height=20><circle r=10 fill="lightgrey" style="transform:translate(10px, 10px)"></circle></svg> either represents one of the United Kingdom's 374's local authorities or one of 3174 counties of the United States of America. Each of these areas is colored according to both the median household income of its residents and the percentage to which its residents have traveled to workplaces (i.e. commuted) during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to 2019 levels. As such, areas coloured in <span class="richtheEconomist">gold</span> represent areas that are both high income and that experienced lower levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic. Here, residents of these wealthier areas were able to successfully reduce their mobility and adopt a work-from-home lifestyle.  In contrast, areas coloured in <span class="poortheEconomist">purple</span> represent areas that are both low income and that did not experience lower levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic.  Residents of these poorer areas were not able to reduce their mobility as much, and they continued to commute to work. Shades of <span class="richHigh">brown</span> represent local authorities that are both high income and that experienced higher levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic.  Regardless of the wealthy status of these areas, residents continued to commute to work. Finally, areas colored in <span class="poorLow">light-grey</span> represent local authorities that are both high income and that experienced higher levels of travel to workplaces throughout the pandemic.<br><br>
                
                For both the United Kingdom and the United States, these charts highlight the existence of a strong social and spatial segregation with regards to who has worked from home and who has continued to commute to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United Kingdom, close to 50% (~30% in the United States) of administrative units are described by either the low income/high commute profile or the high income/low commute profile. Conversely, only 5% (~10% in the United States) of administrative units are described by either the high income/high commute profile or the low income/low commute profile. This trend is explained by the fact that, in both countries, there is a strong negative linear relationship between household income and the intensity of travel to workplaces - that is - the higher your household income is, the less likely you are to travel to work and the more likely you are to work from home.

            <p class="FigSubtitle">This visualization was created using aggregated mobility data for the United Kingdom from <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/?hl=en" target="__blank">Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports</a>, and household income data from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/placeofresidencebylocalauthorityashetable8" target="__blank">Office for National Statistics</a> in the United Kingdom. Raw data was cleaned and processed with Javascript inside this <a href="https://observablehq.com/@lnicoletti/covid-19-and-mobility" target="__blank">Observable notebook. The visualizations themselves were created using the <a>D3.js</a> Javascript framework and the <a href="https://github.com/olihawkins/d3-hexjson" target="__blank">d3-hexjson plugin</a> developed by <a href="https://olihawkins.com/" target="__blank">Oli Hawkins</a> and the Leeds <a href="https://open-innovations.org/about/" target="__blank">Open Innovations</a> team.
